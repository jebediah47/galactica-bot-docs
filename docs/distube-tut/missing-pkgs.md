# Troubleshooting

If you get an error of missing packages, then there is a high chance of prior compilation error, to fix this issue:  
Delete the `node_modules` folder and then run:
```bash
npm install
```  
With this, the issue should be hopefully fixed. If you encounter any other errors open an issue on [`GitHub`](https://github.com/jebediah47/galactica-bot)
