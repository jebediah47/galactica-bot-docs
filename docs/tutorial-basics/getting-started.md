# Downloading the bot

You can download the latest release **(stable)** of galactica from [here](https://github.com/jebediah47/galactica-bot/releases/)

***Or*** get the bleeding-edge ***(unstable)*** version from the git repo by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jebediah47/galactica-bot
```

If you downloaded the from releases you need to extract the archive
  - If using Windows you can extract it by just using the systems default archive manager
  - On Linux you can do so by using any archive manager or by running:
  ```bash
  tar -xf galactica_bot_build_x64.tar.gz
  ```
  or for the zip version:
  ```bash
  unzip galactica_bot_build_x64.zip
  ```

Otherwise you are good to go with the git version

## Checking package integrity (optional)
Checking the package integrity of the download is only possible if downloaded from a [release](https://github.com/jebediah47/galactica-bot/releases/) version.

And here you can find SHA sums for every release and you can check accordingly for the one you downloaded.
